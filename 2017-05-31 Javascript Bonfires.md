Two months ago, I shared [my first steps building static web pages with Free Code Camp](http://www.samuelpath.com/fcc-static/) (FCC). The two little projects I mentionned were useful to get a first grasp of HTML and CSS and their interactions (as well as the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework).

However, I must confess that I'm personally much more interested by the Javascript part of web development. It's the logic and behavior aspects that get me on fire. That's why I did just the minimum required to validate the static pages little projects so that I could move on to the Javascript part.

And I was not disappointed.

The next main session in the [FCC's Front End Development Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.com/map) is called Algorithm Scripting and contains 46 exercises divided in 3 levels: basic, intermediate and advanced. The campers call these challenges "bonfires" (to continue the camp metaphor of course).

According to FCC's maintainers, someone starting to learn JavaScript with FCC should take 50 hours to solve each level, which means that this requires 150 hours (about a month of full-time work). But of course, for someone already familiar with other languages or with JS itself (which was my case), this can go much faster.

Each challenge is layed out in the same way. See below a screenshot of the first challenge (here's a [link](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/reverse-a-string) to the challenge itself):

On the left, you've got the basic instructions, followed by some some documentation links to concepts or methods that could be useful in solving the problem. Then you've got the interaction buttons (run the tests, reset the test, ask for help in the chat room, report a bug) and a browser console for debut purposes. And on the right, you've got the built-in code editor.

The basic level section starts very lightly with challenges such as how to [reverse][https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/reverse-a-string] or [truncate](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/truncate-a-string) a string, [factorialize a number](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/factorialize-a-number) or [return the largest numbers in arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/return-largest-numbers-in-arrays). This section is a really good way to get a first exposure to basic JavaScript syntax and built-in methods (like from the [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/prototype) and [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype?v=control) prototypes). It's perfect for developers familiar with other languages and complete beginners alike.

The intermediate section asks for more algorithmic reflection, and starts to require at least some basic mathematical reasoning. For instance you're asked to [sum all odd fibonacci numbers](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/sum-all-odd-fibonacci-numbers), get the [sorted union of numbers in an unspecified number of arrays](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/sorted-union), or translate strings to [pig latin](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/pig-latin). Here memories of your high school math classes will come in handy.

The advanced level section contains only 9 exercises, but you'll need to up your game in order to solve them. For instance you'll need to create complex regular expressions in order to [validate US telephone numbers](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/validate-us-telephone-numbers), 


- explained why I got so much fun out of it / flow / gamification / lost of time track
- encourage all developers and aspiring developers to do them
- value of checking my old code and refactoring it with best practices (hard to understand my own code sometimes)
- link to my github, and also to FCC forum with solutions (you can see solutions much more elegant and concise than yours -> pushes you to grow and makes you realize the potential progress ahead)
