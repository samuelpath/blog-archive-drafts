We all spend at least some time commuting. In France, the average worker spends 50 minutes a day in commute [source](http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2015/11/02/les-francais-mettent-en-moyenne-50-minutes-pour-l-aller-retour-domicile-travail_4801698_3224.html). When I used to commute using public transportations, I enjoyed watching other people to see what they did with this time. Here are some of the most common activities I witnessed: playing smartphone games, reading the daily free newspaper and listening to the radio or music playlists.

As for me, I was never truly satisfied with these activities. I wanted something more in line with my goals, and more intentional. That's when I discovered podcasts. It was a few years ago now, and since then, I've always listened to podcasts in my commute.

I can truly say that it has been transformational.
