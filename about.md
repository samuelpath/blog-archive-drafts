Hi there!

Thank you for wanting to know a bit more about me and this blog.

I am a software engineer working remotely and as a freelance. My current client is the SaaS company [Esker](http://www.esker.com/) in Lyon, France. Before becoming a developer, I worked a bit more than 2 years as a tech support engineer and as a Scrum Master in the same company.

I got my Master's degree in Computer Science at a university called [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/), where I was able to learn about CS fundamentals and a wide variety of software languages and techniques. I also got the chance to know great people now working for inspiring companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Mozilla and the likes).

However, it’s during my time as a Scrum Master where I did mostly management related tasks that I started missing code and started to get fired up about programming, and more specifically about clean coding practices.

In this blog, I mainly share my take on clean code. On occasion, I write about stuff that doesn’t fit neatly into this category, like life as a freelance and remote developer.

On a personal note, I’m married to Fidji who is a General Practitioner Medical Intern/Resident, and I have 3 kids: Alaïs (♀ born in 2014), Liv (♀ born in 2015) and Léandre (♂ born in 2017).

Beside programming, I’m passionate about international travel, cultures & food, business with a focus on the IT & web industry and child development & psychology (mainly as it relates to parenting).

Thank you again for having read thus far. My goal is to add value to you my readers, while also clarifying my thoughts. I gladly welcome all feedbacks and comments as to how I can improve this blog.
